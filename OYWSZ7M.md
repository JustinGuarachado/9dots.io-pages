## Summary:
	 In this lesson, students will finish their prototype by learning how to import pictures and add lables.
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- Import images into inkscape
-  Recognize each section of their layout at sperate html elements

## Materials:
- Computers with internet access
- Inkscape software [(Download Here)](http://inkscape.org/en/download/) 


## Preperation:
n/a

## Lesson:
#### Discuss:
DISCUSS: Last time students created a basic layout with distinct organized areas. What have we been working on? What is missing from their prototype?

Students will recognize that there are no images yet. To add images they will use the clipart from inkscape. To access it they will go to File > Import From Open Clipart Library. Once the image is imported, students will use the select tool to resize the image.

#### Explore:
Once the students have imported their images, students will continue to customize their prototype in Inkscape. Students should add captions to their images and write small blurbs describing their application. Encourage students to rearrange their website to make them their own.

## Preview:
Take the last 5 minutes to discuss how the prototype will help create their website. To create a website we write in a computer language that is called HTML. When you an internet browser such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox goes to a website, the website sends the browser HTML code. The internet browser then deciphers the code and displays HTML as elements on the page. An element is anything that is shown on the website such as text, image, or a section to help organize both of them together. Each section of your prototype will be a different line of HTML code.
